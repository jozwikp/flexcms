# Flexcms

Flexcms is simple and flexible yet powerful Laravel functionality.! It lets you build a page structure with lists and pages.

Every page can exist within the list or separately. You can build a blog with categories or a lonely contact page.

The most important thing is that you can have a page or a list with whatever url you like for example:

/my-page
/blog/super-category/super-post-with-extra-content
/contact
/about/company

Secondly, Flexcms doesn't change any of the existing Laravel app. You don't even have to add anything to User model.

The last thing is the templates. Every List or Page can have its own blade template.

The last, last thing is the fact that Flexcms is ultra fast. Every Page and List is fully cached. No database request.
